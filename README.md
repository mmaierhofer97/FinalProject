### Project Summary
This is a program to search & sign up for classes. The classes are organized into a Binary Search Tree, while your class schedule is organized in a vector. You may search for a course by name, and view the teacher, department, time, and enrollment availability of that class. You may add a class into your class schedule, and remove the class from your schedule (when adding a dropping, the class enrollment total is updated). A class cannot be added if the class has reached capacity, or already been added to your schedule.

### How To Run
1. Open your terminal on your virtual machine desktop (all steps will be done through virtual machine because your vm has codeblocks on it).
2. In your terminal, navigate to a place in your folders that you will be able to find the project and feel comfortable storing and looking at this project (use **ls** to see contents in your current directory, use **cd [folder you wish to navigate into here]** to move into a directory of your choice, us **cd ..** to move back a directory). For example, you might want to cd into your Dropbox or Documents folder.
3. Once you get there, run this command in your terminal: **_git clone https://github.com/kmegoryc/FinalProject.git_** Nice job! You should now see my project (titled FinalProject) in your current directory. Command _ls_ to see it listed there.
4. Open finder and navigate to the directory you orignally cd'd into and cloned my project into. Double click FinalProject.cbp to view and run my project.
5. Click run and you're done!
