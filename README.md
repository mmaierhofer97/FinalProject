### Project Summary
This is a program to search & sign up for classes. The classes are organized into a Binary Search Tree, while the your class schedule is organized in a vector. The user will be able to search for a course by name, and be able to view the teacher, department, time, and enrollment availability of that class. The user will be able to add a class into their class schedule, and remove the class from their schedule, while responsively updating class enrollment. A class cannot be added if the class has reached capacity, or already been added to your schedule.

### How To Run
1. Open your terminal on your virtual machine desktop (all steps will be done through virtual machine because your vm has codeblocks on it).
2. Navigate to a place in your folders that you will be able to find the project and feel comfortable storing and looking at this project (use _ls_ to see contents in your current directory, use _cd [folder you wish to navigate into here]_ to move into a directory of your choice). For example, you might want to cd into your Dropbox or Documents folder.
2. Run this command in your terminal: _git clone https://github.com/kmegoryc/FinalProject.git_ 

Nice job! You should now see my project (titled FinalProject) in your current directory. Command _ls_ to see it listed there.
3. Open finder and navigate to the directory you orignally cd'd into and cloned my project into. Double click FinalProject.cbp to view and run my project.
4. Click run and you're done!
